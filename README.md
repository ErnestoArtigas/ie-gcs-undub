Instead of copying just the changed language files, I replaced all of the files with the japanese version. Music, especially in cutscenes, is lower in the japanese version compared to the european version, leading to voices being sometimes inaudible when undubbing. Other files like the credits don't have prefix to identify, even though they are different in the japanese and european version. That's why this is a hefty pack.
